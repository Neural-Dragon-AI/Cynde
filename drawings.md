Apologies for the confusion. It seems like there was an issue with the formatting of the mermaid graph. Let me provide you with the corrected version:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Cynde Framework] --> B[LLM Integration]
    B --> C[OpenAI API-Compatible Servers]
    C --> D[Cloud-Hosted]
    C --> E[Locally-Hosted]
    B --> F[Self-Hosted Deployments with Modal]
    F --> G[Hugging Face TGI]
    F --> H[Hugging Face TEI]
    
    A --> I[Data Processing]
    I --> J[Polars DataFrames]
    I --> K[Pydantic Models]
    I --> L[Gradient Boosted Trees <br> (scikit-learn)]
    
    A --> M[Functional API]
    M --> N[cynde.functional.embed]
    N --> O[Embedding Generation]
    M --> P[cynde.functional.generate]
    P --> Q[Structured Text Generation]
    Q --> R[Pydantic with Outlines]
    M --> S[cynde.functional.predict]
    S --> T[Predictive Modeling]
    
    F --> U[Autoscaling]
    U --> V[GPU Workload]
    U --> W[CPU Workload]
    
    A --> X[Observability]
    X --> Y[Logfire Integration]
```

In this corrected mermaid graph:

1. The formatting issue with the "Gradient Boosted Trees (scikit-learn)" node has been fixed by adding a line break (`<br>`) to separate the text into two lines.

2. All other components and connections remain the same as in the previous graph.

The graph now correctly represents the integrated architecture of the Cynde framework, including:

- LLM Integration with OpenAI API-Compatible Servers (Cloud-Hosted and Locally-Hosted) and Self-Hosted Deployments with Modal (Hugging Face TGI and TEI).
- Data Processing using Polars DataFrames, Pydantic Models, and Gradient Boosted Trees (scikit-learn).
- Functional API with modules for embedding generation, structured text generation (using Pydantic with Outlines), and predictive modeling.
- Autoscaling of GPU and CPU workloads handled by Modal for self-hosted deployments.
- Observability with Logfire Integration for monitoring and analyzing runtime behavior and performance.

This mermaid graph provides a clear and concise overview of how the different components of Cynde work together to enable scalable, flexible, and structured LLM-powered data processing workflows.
