Absolutely! Let's integrate the deployment columns, add a reference to gradient boosted trees (scikit-learn) in data processing, and include a reference to structured generation via Pydantic with Outlines. Here's the updated mermaid graph:

```

In this updated mermaid graph:

1. LLM Integration:
   - The OpenAI API-Compatible Servers remain divided into Cloud-Hosted and Locally-Hosted options.
   - The Self-Hosted Deployments are now explicitly linked to Modal, indicating that Cynde uses Modal for deploying self-hosted instances of Hugging Face TGI and TEI.

2. Data Processing:
   - Polars DataFrames and Pydantic Models remain as key components for data processing and validation.
   - A new component, Gradient Boosted Trees (scikit-learn), has been added to highlight Cynde's integration with scikit-learn for gradient boosting algorithms in predictive modeling tasks.

3. Functional API:
   - The `cynde.functional.embed` and `cynde.functional.predict` modules remain the same.
   - Under the `cynde.functional.generate` module, Structured Text Generation is now linked to Pydantic with Outlines, indicating the use of Pydantic models in combination with the Outlines library for generating structured text outputs.

4. Deployment:
   - The Autoscaling component is now directly connected to the Self-Hosted Deployments with Modal, emphasizing that Modal handles the autoscaling of both GPU and CPU workloads for the self-hosted TGI and TEI instances.

5. Observability remains the same, with Logfire Integration for monitoring and analyzing the runtime behavior and performance of Cynde workflows.

This updated mermaid graph provides a more streamlined and integrated view of the Cynde framework's architecture. It consolidates the deployment options, highlighting the use of Modal for self-hosted deployments of Hugging Face TGI and TEI, along with Modal's autoscaling capabilities.

The graph also introduces gradient boosted trees (scikit-learn) as a key component in the data processing pipeline, showcasing Cynde's integration with popular machine learning libraries for predictive modeling tasks.

Furthermore, the reference to structured text generation using Pydantic with Outlines emphasizes Cynde's capability to generate structured outputs based on predefined Pydantic models, leveraging the Outlines library for constrained generation.

By presenting the framework in this integrated manner, the mermaid graph provides a clearer understanding of how the different components of Cynde work together to enable scalable, flexible, and structured LLM-powered data processing workflows.
